# Interactive Visual Exploration of Causal Structures for Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis

Revealing causal structures from observational data is an essential task in many data analysis issues across various domains. Causal structures are commonly visualized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) or a node-link diagram, in which nodes represent variables, and edges represent causal relationships between them. However, these simple static graphs do not convey sufficient information for either a clear interpretation to novel viewers, or an in-depth exploration for experts. In this study, the visualization of causal structures is set into context. 

An interactive system to explore causal structures for neuropathic pain diagnosis is developed here, with the help of application-specific visualizations. The system consists of three parts: i) the body template for selecting discomfort areas or symptoms, ii) the pattern nodes showing a set of problematic nerves, and iii) the spinal cord diagram for showing the problematic vertebrae, i.e. original cause of discomfort. All of the three parts are interactive. When symptoms are selected, both related pattern nodes and vertebrae will be highlighted in red, whose transparency will increase when more selected symptoms are related to them. When hovering on pattern nodes or vertebrae, the related areas in the other two parts (i.e. symptoms and vertebrae or pattern nodes) will also be highlighted in blue.
